# pokemonCardGame

[IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED FOR REASONS OTHERS THAN STUDYING]

Just a simple card game to learn and test my skills

1 - The code has not every single pokemon (not even from 1st gen)

2 - i still need to learn how to style the page

3 - the status are not matching when you play against the machine's card, which should happen (needs to be changed)
