# pokemonCardGame

[IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED FOR REASONS OTHERS THAN STUDYING]

Just a simple card game to learn and test my skills

1 - The code has not every single pokemon (only 1st gen, more poekmons are to be added if Pokemon API adds them n JSON, easy to add them on JS file)

2 - yet to improve CSS with a more "pokemon looking" theme

3 - branch created (called scalable) so i can study js' scalability, mind which branch you are, future gabe!

4 - scalable branch is working at this moment but there are lines that still need to be sorted, so i'm probably creating another branch to have scalable as a backup (other than main backup)
